This Perl module implements the Cache Digest protocol as found in the
Squid WWW cache server package, documented separately in the file
cache-digest-v5.txt included here.  The module is self-documenting,
so do a 'perldoc WebCache::Digest' after installing it for info.



                           *** WARNING ***

Cache Digests are an unstable, experimental protocol.  Don't build
them into any production systems unless you are prepared to change
your implementation at short notice!  Expect the specification to
change!

                           *** WARNING ***



If you downloaded this package from CPAN or a CPAN mirror site, you
may want to check back to its home page to see if there's a newer
version:  <URL:http://wwwcache.ja.net/dev/perlmod/>

You install the module by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Please report any bugs/suggestions to the author at the above address.



Two sample programs are included to illustrate how the WebCache::Digest
module may be used in your programs:

  dpeek.pl - lookup URLs in Cache Digest loaded from disk or
               fetched over HTTP
  dpoke.pl - create a Cache Digest given a list of URLs, and
               save it to disk for later processing

These are self-documenting using POD, as with the main WebCache::Digest
module itself.
